# Appwrite Configuration

To interact with the Appwrite database and storage, we'll utilize several JavaScript classes provided by Appwrite:

1. **Client**: An instance of this class is used to establish a connection with your Appwrite project.
2. **Databases**: An instance of this class is used to retrieve and insert data into the databases defined in your project.
3. **Storage**: An instance of this class is used to perform file upload, download, retrieve file URLs, and delete files on the Appwrite server.

\
By utilizing these classes, we can effectively communicate with the Appwrite backend and perform necessary tasks related to data management and file storage.

## Sample Code

Here's a sample code snippet to demonstrate the usage of these classes:

```javascript
// Import the necessary Appwrite classes
import { Client } from "appwrite";
import { Databases } from "appwrite";
import { Storage } from "appwrite";

// Create an instance of the Client class
const client = new Client();

// Set the endpoint and project ID for your Appwrite project
client.setEndpoint("[APPWRITE_ENDPOINT]");
client.setProject("[APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID]");

// Create an instance of the Databases class
const databases = new Databases(client);

// Retrieve data from a specific database collection
const collectionId = "[COLLECTION_ID]";
databases
    .listDocuments(collectionId)
    .then((response) => {
        // Handle the retrieved data
        console.log(response);
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        // Handle any errors
        console.error(error);
    });

// Create an instance of the Storage class
const storage = new Storage(client);

// Upload a file to the Appwrite server
const file = "[FILE_PATH]";
const fileName = "[FILE_NAME]";
storage
    .createFile(file, fileName)
    .then((response) => {
        // Handle the uploaded file response
        console.log(response);
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        // Handle any errors
        console.error(error);
    });
```
