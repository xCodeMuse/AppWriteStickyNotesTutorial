# React Context API

This directory primarily contains the NoteContext module, which serves as a central hub for managing the list of notes and provides methods for manipulating notes, including creation, updating, and more. These methods return Promises, ensuring asynchronous handling of data operations. Internally, the NoteContext utilizes helper functions to interact with the Appwrite server, facilitating seamless data manipulation according to specific requirements.

In addition to the NoteContext, this directory includes the LoaderContext module, which offers functionality for managing the loading status of the page. It provides a method to change the loading status.
